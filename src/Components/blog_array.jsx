    paragraph:"Carl, the Invoker, is a ranged intelligence hero who is very difficult to master. He is unique in that he possesses a total of 14 abilities in his arsenal; three of them - Quas, Wex, and Exort - are reagents and one is his special ultimate Invoke. The three abilities he learns throughout leveling up can have three instances, which serve as the basic ingredients or components for him to create a new ability using his ultimate. Once the reagents or elements are combined, he can invoke one out of ten different abilities. All of his invoked abilities are capable of a multitude of actions, from damaging enemies to aiding his allies, and even saving himself from danger. His three reagents can be upgraded up to level 7 which determines the power and potency of his invoked abilities, making it more powerful than an ordinary spell. Because of this, he can be played in almost any role possible. Invoker can be a carry, semi-carry, ganker, pusher, initiator or even support. His three reagents provide a passive bonus per instance, allowing for specialization at early levels and situational boosts at later levels. His extremely flexible nature allows him to use many different combinations of items effectively but also make him dependent on solid builds and a good gold advantage."},

        paragraph:"The support role in Dota 2 has the lowest farm priority on the team. Supports are responsible for making sure their team’s cores – the carry and offlaner – have a comfortable laning phase. They need this in order to get the farm and experience that they need. Support heroes are blessed with powerful abilities, which are most useful in the early to mid game. They are able to impact the game even from the very start with their spells. They can even score kills kills in the laning phase, provided they have the right lane partners to synergize with. Some support heroes, on the other hand, are more defensive in nature. Their goal is to protect their cores or themselves more than to threaten their lane opponents. Support strength in the early goings is balanced out by their relatively low survivability. Most support heroes in Dota 2 have low base armor and health values to start with. These characteristics combined with their disruptive natures make them high-priority targets in gank attempts and teamfights. Thus, necessitating that support players be careful with their positioning at all times. They are also designed to be less impactful in deep late game situations, as support heroes are not meant to carry games"

        paragraph:"The hard carry role (known as “safe lane” in ranked role queue) is the first of the core positions in Dota 2. Carries are primarily tasked with farming creeps in the early to mid game, often leaving the fighting during those stages to other members of their team. This is because carries are the most item-dependent heroes in Dota 2, and are otherwise extremely weak without them. They do, however, make up for this in the late game, which is when they are at their strongest. Carry heroes can put out tremendous amounts of physical damage over a short period of time in the late game, especially when they have their desired items on hand. The concept of the carry in the late game is very important considering most other core heroes fall off during that time, due to spell-based damage being more unreliable later on."
